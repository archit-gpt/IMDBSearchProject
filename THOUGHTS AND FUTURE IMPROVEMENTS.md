# Thoughts and Future Improvements

## Current Limitations

1. **Field-Specific Search**: Users must specify the field (e.g., title, year) to search, which can be restrictive and less intuitive.
2. **No User Preferences or History**: The application does not support user profiles, preferences, or search history, limiting personalization.
3. **Inverted Index Approach**: May not be the best solution for handling complex queries or achieving high relevance in search results.
4. **In-Memory Processing**: The dataset is loaded into memory, limiting scalability and performance for larger datasets.

## Potential Improvements and Extensibility

1. **Flexible Search Engine**:
   - **Vector Database**: Use a vector database or dense retrieval model for semantic search, allowing more intuitive, context-aware queries.
   - **Multi-Field Search**: Enable simultaneous searches across multiple fields without requiring field specification.

2. **Advanced Search Features**:
   - **Complex Queries**: Support logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) for combining multiple criteria in searches.
   - **Dynamic Filters**: Extend existing filters with additional criteria like runtime, director, and actor combinations.

3. **Scalability and Performance**:
   - **Database Integration**: Use scalable databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) instead of in-memory processing.
   - **Indexing and Caching**: Implement indexing on frequently queried fields and caching for repeated queries.

4. **User Customization and Profiles**:
   - **User Accounts**: Allow users to create accounts, save preferences, favorite movies, and search history.
   - **Personalized Recommendations**: Use machine learning for personalized movie recommendations based on user behavior.

5. **Enhanced Search Algorithm**:
   - **Relevance Scoring**: Develop a sophisticated relevance scoring algorithm considering term frequency, movie popularity, and user ratings.
   - **Fuzzy Matching and Suggestions**: Improve fuzzy matching and add search suggestions.

## Final Vision

Emulate the functionality and user experience of advanced search engines like IMDB's search feature by:
- Providing flexible, context-aware searches.
- Supporting complex, multi-criteria queries.
- Offering personalized user experiences through profiles and recommendations.
- Enhancing scalability and performance for larger datasets and more complex queries.
